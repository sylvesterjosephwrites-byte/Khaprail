# 02 — Design System

## Palette (current — reverted 2026-08-28 back to the original terracotta palette)

Heritage clay-tile brand — warm, natural, craft-forward. Avoid cold tech-startup blues/purples.
- Primary: terracotta / clay orange (`#B5502B`)
- Secondary: warm sand / beige (`#E8DCC8`)
- Accent: clay orange, slightly lighter/warmer than primary (`#C96A3D`)
- Neutral background: warm off-white, not pure white (`#FAF6F0`); body/heading text espresso brown (`#3B2A20`)
- Use color sparingly for CTAs and badges — the product photography should carry most of the visual weight

~~**2026-08-25 dark restyle (superseded 2026-08-28):** dark charcoal (`#1f1f1f`–`#262626`), solid navy nav strip/footer, action blue (`#2F6FED`) CTAs, gold (`#F2A93B`) price text, a light powder-blue hero exception.~~ Reverted — see the "Storefront palette revert" note below for why and how.

### Storefront palette revert (2026-08-28)

Reverted `src/index.css`'s `:root` token block from the dark-charcoal values back to the original terracotta/sand/espresso values (recovered verbatim via `git show 24b47e7^:khaprail-website/src/index.css`, the commit right before the dark restyle). Everything built during the dark-restyle era (two-bar header, mega-menu, toned product-rail panels, circular icon badges, pagination, the type-scale bump) **stayed** — only the color tokens changed. Admin (`/admin/*`) is unaffected either way; its `--sidebar-*` tokens were never touched by either restyle.

The dark restyle had introduced 6 tokens with no equivalent in the original palette (`--navy`, `--navy-foreground`, `--panel-navy`, `--panel-warm`, `--price`, `--hero`, `--hero-foreground`), used across ~10 files (header nav strip, footer, floating WhatsApp button, "New"/"NEW" badges, alternating product-rail panel tones, price text, Hero/Heritage photo-wash banners). Rather than deleting them and editing every call site, they're kept as `var()` aliases onto the restored base palette, so they resolve to terracotta-appropriate colors automatically:

| Token | Resolves to | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--navy` / `--navy-foreground` | `var(--foreground)` espresso / `var(--background)` cream | header nav strip, footer, floating WhatsApp button, "New Arrival"/"NEW" badges |
| `--panel-navy` | `var(--secondary)` sand | one alternating product-rail panel tone, Feature Row's photo-card backdrop |
| `--panel-warm` | `var(--muted)` warm off-white | the other alternating panel tone (Top Picks Today, New Arrivals, Category Showcase) |
| `--price` | `var(--accent)` clay orange | product price text |
| `--hero` / `--hero-foreground` | `var(--foreground)` espresso / `var(--background)` cream | Hero/Heritage photo-wash overlay + text/pill/button color over it |

Repointing `--hero`→espresso and `--hero-foreground`→cream reproduces, in effect, the exact pre-dark-restyle Hero design already built and contrast-verified in this repo (`00-PROGRESS.md`'s 2026-08-24 "full-bleed placeholder photo hero" entry) — no component edit needed, Hero/Heritage just inherited the correct look from the token change.

Two hardcoded (non-token) values elsewhere didn't auto-correct and needed real edits: `site-header.tsx`'s wordmark (`text-[#1f1f1f]`, a literal leftover dark-theme hex → `text-primary`) and `category-showcase.tsx`'s photo-placeholder box + caption (`bg-black/20` → `bg-foreground/10`, `text-white` → `text-foreground` — the caption sits directly on the now-light `panel-warm` background, so white text would've been stranded/invisible). Grepped every `.tsx` for `text-white|bg-black|bg-white|text-black|#[hex]` to confirm nothing else needed a change — the remaining hits (`dialog.tsx`/`sheet.tsx` modal scrims, `video-grid.tsx`/`video-lightbox.tsx` play-button overlays) are theme-agnostic dark scrims over actual photo/video content, unrelated to page theme.

Contrast verified in-browser (zoom screenshots on Hero's cream-on-espresso text and the icon badges) — everything reads comfortably above AA. Icon badges (`text-primary`/`text-accent` solid icon on `bg-primary/15`/`bg-accent/15` tinted circle) are now visually more subtle than under the dark theme, since primary and accent are both warm orange-browns rather than the previous blue-vs-gold pairing — still clearly two-tone on close look, not a contrast problem, just a quieter rhythm effect; flag to Sylvester if a more differentiated two-tone badge alternation is wanted.

## Typography

**Current (2026-08-25 dark restyle):** Single type family site-wide: **Inter** (variable, self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable/inter`). No specific replacement typeface was named when the terracotta/Baloo 2 direction was superseded, so Inter was chosen as a clean, highly-legible default for the new dark e-commerce-style theme — swap `@fontsource-variable/inter` and the `--font-display` value in `src/index.css` if a different family is wanted. Same single-family/weight-hierarchy approach as before (no separate heading/body pairing).

### Type scale bump (2026-08-27)

Storefront text read too small/thin, so every prominent tier was bumped one Tailwind step up (font-weight unchanged — this stacks on top of the existing bold headings, it doesn't replace them). Admin (`/admin/*`) was deliberately left untouched, same "separate chrome" rule as every prior visual pass. Applied per-component (this codebase doesn't centralize heading sizes in one token — each page/section repeats its own `text-*` classes, same pattern the 2026-08-24 "heading size & weight pass" used), not via a Tailwind `--text-*` scale override, specifically so admin wouldn't inherit the bump too:

| Element | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Page `<h1>` titles (Products, Categories, category name, blog post, etc.) | `text-5xl sm:text-6xl` | `text-6xl sm:text-7xl` |
| Section `<h2>` headings (rail titles, CTA banner, FAQ, "Explore Our Range") | `text-3xl sm:text-4xl` | `text-4xl sm:text-5xl` |
| Category-detail "Explore {category}" subcategory-row heading | `text-2xl` | `text-3xl` |
| PDP product name / price | `text-3xl` / `text-2xl` | `text-4xl` / `text-3xl` |
| Hero `<h1>` | `text-5xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-7xl`, `max-w-2xl` | `text-6xl sm:text-7xl lg:text-8xl`, `max-w-3xl` (widened so the bigger text doesn't over-wrap) — **superseded 2026-08-28**, see the "Hero size reduction" note below: stepped back down to `text-5xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-7xl` with `max-w-4xl` |
| Heritage banner heading | `text-4xl sm:text-5xl` | `text-5xl sm:text-6xl` |
| Navbar logo wordmark | `text-2xl` | `text-3xl` |
| Navbar nav-strip links/mega-menu trigger | `text-[0.9rem]` | `text-base` (tightened trigger/link `px`  and `NavigationMenuList` gap to keep it from wrapping at the `lg:` floor — verified clean at 1024px/1280px/1536px) |
| Mega-menu category-card / circular-badge labels | `text-xs`–`text-sm` | `text-sm`–`text-lg` depending on context |
| Primary CTA buttons ("Get a Sample," "Download Catalog/Spec Sheet," checkout-style banners) | `h-12 px-6 text-base` | `h-14 px-7 text-lg` |
| Header/mobile-nav "Get a Sample" | `h-10/h-11 text-sm/text-base` | `h-11/h-12 text-base/text-lg` |
| Product-card title, PDP "Product Details" prose, blog excerpt | `text-sm` (inherited) | `text-base` |

Verified: `npm run build`/`npm run lint` clean, no new warning categories. In-browser at 1024px/1280px/1536px desktop widths the navbar strip fits with room to spare, no wrap. Real mobile-viewport screenshot not captured — same recurring browser-automation-tool limitation noted throughout `00-PROGRESS.md`'s session log (window resize doesn't change the actual viewport in this environment); the responsive classes were verified by code inspection instead.

### Hero size reduction (2026-08-28)

The batch-17 bump made the Hero too dominant — a 4-line headline that pushed the CTAs below the fold. Stepped the whole block back down one notch (font-weight/copy/photo/CTA-behavior unchanged, sizing/spacing only):

| Hero element | Was (batch 17) | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Container padding | `py-24 lg:py-32` | `py-14 lg:py-20` |
| Content gap | `gap-6` | `gap-4` |
| Headline | `text-5xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-7xl`, `max-w-2xl` | `text-6xl sm:text-7xl lg:text-8xl`, `max-w-3xl` → **reverted to `text-5xl sm:text-6xl lg:text-7xl`, widened to `max-w-4xl`** (the wider `max-w` at the smaller font is what brings it to 3 lines instead of 4) |
| Subtext | `text-lg` | `text-xl` → **reverted to `text-lg`** |

CTA buttons (`h-14 px-7 text-lg`) and the eyebrow badge were left as-is — out of this pass's stated scope. Verified in-browser at 1536px and 1024px: headline wraps to 3 lines, the full hero block (badge through both CTAs) fits inside a single ~700px-tall viewport instead of needing a scroll.

~~Single type family site-wide: Baloo 2 (variable, weights 400–800), matching the real Khaprail logo wordmark...~~ — superseded; Baloo 2/Fredoka/Quicksand were all part of the earlier rounded-sans direction this restyle replaced.
- Generous line-height on body copy — this audience includes older, non-tech-fluent visitors researching a home-construction decision, not a fast tech audience

## Circular icon-badge component (2026-08-27, palette updated 2026-08-28)

`CategoryBadgeCircle` (`src/components/shared/category-badge-circle.tsx`) — an outlined Lucide icon centered in a soft-tinted circle, label rendered by the caller underneath (reference: a "Shop by Department"-style icon-badge row). Fill alternates between the two real accent colors at low opacity — `bg-primary/15` + `bg-accent/15` (both terracotta/clay-orange family under the current palette; was navy-blue/gold under the now-reverted dark restyle) — instead of the old per-index rainbow placeholder palette (`category-fill-palette.ts`, removed); falls back to the real `cover_image_url` photo once a category actually has one (none do yet). The icon itself comes from `src/lib/category-icons.tsx`'s `getCategoryIcon(name)` — a keyword-matched Lucide mapping built against the real `12-CATEGORY-TAXONOMY.md` category/subcategory names (Kitchen → ChefHat, Bathroom → Bath, Outdoor → Sun, Pool → Waves, Terracotta/Clay → Flame, Concrete/Brick → Blocks, Mosaic → Grid3x3, Jali → Wind, Industrial → Warehouse, Stone → Mountain, Khaprail → Building2, Roof → Home, Floor → SquareStack, Wall → Grid2x2, default → LayoutGrid). No icon-per-category manifest existed anywhere in this codebase before this pass — this is a new mapping, not a reuse of an existing one, since the closest prior thing (`application-tags.tsx`) was deleted in batch 11.

Used by: the homepage's Featured Categories row (all root categories, right after the hero) and Trending Categories grid (`size="lg"`), and the category-detail page's "Explore {category}" subcategory row (e.g. Wall Tiles → Kitchen/Bathroom/Outdoor/Terracotta/Concrete/Mosaic Wall Tiles) — this last one is the closest real analog on this site to a "shop by space/application" row, since Khaprail's taxonomy models kitchen/bathroom/outdoor as subcategories rather than a separate top-level axis.

**Scrollbar (2026-08-28, refined same day):** the horizontal scroll containers on this row and on `ProductRail` used to show a persistent native scrollbar track below the content. First fix hid it outright (`scrollbar-hide`); refined same day into a hover-reveal treatment instead, since a fully-hidden scrollbar gives no affordance that a row is scrollable. Current utility is `scrollbar-fade` (`src/index.css`) — invisible at rest (`scrollbar-color`/`::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` transparent), a thin (6px) low-contrast gray thumb fades in via `:hover`/`:active`/`:focus-within` on the scroll container. Applied to the same two spots (`category-icon-rail.tsx`, `product-rail.tsx` — the latter backs every homepage/PDP/category-page rail, so New Arrivals/Best Sellers/Top Picks Today/Similar Products/Explore More Products all inherit it). Scroll functionality (arrow buttons, touch/trackpad/keyboard) is unaffected, only the visual scrollbar chrome changes. Not applied to `compare-table.tsx`'s data table, which keeps its default visible scrollbar since that's a plain wide table, not a carousel.

## Shop by Category tabbed section (2026-09-10)

New homepage section (`src/components/home/shop-by-category-section.tsx`, not part of `10-HOMEPAGE-SPEC.md`'s confirmed section order — see `00-PROGRESS.md`): a centered "Shop by Category" heading/subheading, an accessible pill-style category tablist, and a `ProductRail` product carousel that refetches on tab change. Categories are admin-toggled via a new `categories.is_featured` boolean (checkbox added to the existing `/admin/categories/:id/edit` form, same pattern as `products.is_featured`) and only appear as a tab once they also have at least one real product — a tab never opens onto an empty carousel by construction, though the empty-state copy (`"More {Category} coming soon."`) still exists defensively in case a category's last product is deleted after the tab list loads.

Tabs reuse the shared Base UI `Tabs` primitive (`src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`, previously only used by the admin blog editor's Content/SEO/AEO-GEO/FAQ tabs) restyled into pills (`src/components/shared/category-tab-list.tsx`) — terracotta solid fill (`bg-primary`) for the active tab, neutral outline (`border-border bg-background`) for the rest — rather than a second hand-rolled tab implementation, so the whole site has one tested WAI-ARIA tablist behavior (role="tablist"/"tab", roving tabindex, arrow-key nav with `activateOnFocus` so arrow movement selects immediately). `ProductRail` gained an optional `title` (now omittable, for sections like this one that render their own heading separately) — no other call site was affected.

## Tiles for Every Space editorial section (2026-09-10)

New homepage section (`src/components/home/lifestyle-tiles-section.tsx`) — an admin-curated alternative to "Explore Our Range" (`CategoryShowcase`) that does the same "browse by space" job with hand-picked photography instead of data-driven category picks. Backed by a new `lifestyle_tiles` table (`image_url`/`image_alt_text`/`caption`/`link_url`/`sort_order`/`is_active`, public-read active-only + authenticated-manage RLS, same 3-policy shape as `blog_posts`) with a full `/admin/lifestyle-tiles` CRUD panel (list with thumbnail + inline activate/deactivate toggle, add/edit form). Kept deliberately visually distinct from Category Showcase despite the shared "N photo cards + caption" shape: heading sits above the framed panel here (Category Showcase's sits inside it), `4:5` portrait photos instead of `3:4`, and a `bg-muted` panel instead of `bg-panel-warm`. Column count matches the active tile count (1/2/3) rather than always reserving 3 slots, so a partially-filled admin list never leaves an empty grid gap; the whole section hides itself when zero tiles are active, same "honest data only" pattern as every other homepage section. Photos are `loading="lazy"` since they're large.

## Offers, Available Now section (2026-09-10)

New homepage section (`src/components/home/offers-section.tsx`, placed right after Featured Categories — early, conversion-focused positioning) modeled on a 4-card "end-of-year offers" reference, but **without percentage-off discounts** — Khaprail has no confirmed live promotion. Each card's `badge_value`/`badge_suffix`/`label` must describe a real, always-true capability instead (free samples, bulk pricing, delivery, new-customer welcome) — fully admin-editable via a new `offer_cards` table + `/admin/offer-cards` CRUD panel (same list/edit/toggle/delete shape as `lifestyle_tiles`) so real numbers can replace the placeholder wording the moment an actual promotion is confirmed, with zero code change. Card visual: `bg-navy` (dark espresso — `--navy` aliases `--foreground`) with a `bg-gradient-to-t from-navy via-navy/85 to-navy/20` wash over an image anchored at the bottom, big bold `text-accent` (terracotta) badge value + smaller badge suffix, label text, and an underlined `link_label` — only the link text is the click target here, unlike Lifestyle Tiles' whole-card links, matching the reference's "Shop now" text-link pattern. `link_url` accepts either an internal path (rendered as a router `Link`) or a full `https://` URL (rendered as an external `<a target="_blank">`) — needed because the seeded "Get a Sample" card links to a WhatsApp deep link (`buildWhatsAppUrl`'s exact message wording, reused from `hero.tsx`), not an internal route. Column count tracks the active-card count (1/2/3/4) same as Lifestyle Tiles; hides entirely at zero active cards.

Seeded 4 starting cards using real, already-uploaded category photography (no dedicated "offers" photography exists yet — swap via `/admin/offer-cards` once available, same as every other still-photo-less spot on the site). "Fast Delivery" and "New Customer" are deliberately vague, placeholder-flagged content (see the table's `comment on table` and the admin list page's on-page notice) — real delivery terms and a real new-customer discount, if either is ever confirmed, replace this wording via the admin form; if no new-customer offer is ever planned, deactivate that card instead of leaving invented terms live.

Like every other image field in this admin (`categories.cover_image_url`, `products.cover_image_url`), the image field is a plain "paste the Storage URL" text input, not a file-upload widget — no such uploader exists anywhere in this codebase (files still go up via the Supabase Dashboard, then the URL is pasted in). The request asked for "image upload reusing the existing uploader," which doesn't correspond to anything real here — mapped onto the established pattern instead; see `00-PROGRESS.md`.

## Trending in Tiles bento grid (2026-09-10)

New homepage section (`src/components/home/trending-tiles-section.tsx`) — a fixed 4-slot bento grid (`large` full-height left, `small_top_left`/`small_top_right` stacked top-right, `wide_bottom` spanning the bottom of the right column), backed by a new `trending_tiles` table (`grid_position`/`image_url`/`image_alt_text`/`show_new_badge`/`title`/`subtitle`/`link_url`/`is_active`, same public-read-active + authenticated-manage RLS shape as every other admin-curated table) with a `/admin/trending-tiles` CRUD panel (`grid_position` as a 4-option dropdown, not free text). No DB uniqueness constraint on `grid_position` — if two active tiles ever claim the same slot, `useTrendingTiles` picks the most recently updated one (documented on the table itself via `comment on table`).

Grid CSS: `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3` with **no `grid-rows-*` utility** — this was a real bug caught during QA, not a stylistic choice: `lg:grid-rows-2` forces two equal `1fr` row tracks, which stretches the small tiles' row to match the wide tile's taller row and leaves a visible empty gap under the small tiles. Removing it lets each row size to its own content (`aspect-[4/3]` on the two small tiles, `aspect-[2/1]` on `wide_bottom`), and the `large` tile (`row-span-2`, `aspect-auto` at `lg`) stretches across the combined natural height via the grid's default `align-items: stretch` — confirmed via a live `getComputedStyle` check (300px + 16px gap + 408px = 724px, matching exactly). Each tile is a whole-card `Link` (unlike Offers' text-only links) with a `group-hover:scale-105` image zoom (same treatment as Lifestyle Tiles), a `bg-accent` (terracotta, not the reference's blue) "NEW" pill top-left gated on `show_new_badge`, and a `bg-navy/80` caption bar (bold title + smaller subtitle, light text) anchored to the bottom via `absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0`.

Renders the full bento shape only when all 4 canonical positions have an active tile; with fewer, it falls back to a simple `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` wrap of whatever exists (same "never leave a broken/empty layout" rule as every other partial-content homepage section) rather than trying to preserve the asymmetric shape with holes in it. Seeded 4 starting tiles using real, already-uploaded category photography (no dedicated "trending" photography exists yet, same gap as Offers/Lifestyle Tiles — swap via `/admin/trending-tiles` once available).

## Mobile navigation (2026-09-10)

A three-piece mobile-only pattern (below the `lg` breakpoint — desktop nav is completely untouched), ported from the sibling Artisan site with Khaprail-specific swaps:

**Bottom tab bar** (`src/components/nav/mobile-tab-bar.tsx`, rendered globally in `SiteLayout`) — fixed, `z-40`, `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` padding. 5 items: Home (`/`), Filters (opens the filters drawer — see below), an elevated circular `bg-accent` "Get a Sample" WhatsApp button (raised above the row, same message/number as `hero.tsx`'s CTA), Catalog (links to `/downloads`, the existing "Download Full Catalog" page — no separate PDF-trigger logic was duplicated into the global layout), and Contact (links to `/contact`). Active tab is styled by matching `location.pathname`. Hides itself entirely (unmounts, doesn't just visually hide) whenever the category drawer or filters drawer is open, via a small shared `MobileDrawerProvider` context (`src/lib/mobile-drawer-context.tsx`) for the category drawer's open state, and a direct `location.hash` check for the filters drawer's. The existing `FloatingWhatsAppButton` (bottom-right bubble) is now `hidden lg:flex` — the tab bar's elevated CTA does that job on mobile, and the two would otherwise stack in the same corner.

**Category drawer** (hamburger menu, `src/components/nav/mobile-nav.tsx` — rewritten, not new) — header row is a close (X) + "Khaprail Tiles" wordmark; no search icon, since no real search feature exists anywhere on this site (per the standing "no dead/non-functional affordances" rule) and the request's own phrasing hedged this ("if search exists"). Below that: a flat, single-open accordion of all 15 real root categories (pulled live from `categories`, same as the desktop mega-menu — never hardcoded), each its own row with a `⌄` chevron. Single-open is enforced manually (`openCategoryId` state + a diff against the accordion's reported value array) since Base UI's `Accordion` value is natively multi-select. Only 2 of the 15 real root categories (Wall Tiles, Floor Tiles) have subcategories today — a leaf root category (the other 13) skips the accordion entirely and navigates straight to its listing on tap, since expanding onto an empty panel would be a dead interaction. Below the category list: a visually distinct `bg-secondary` "Download Catalogue" promo row (links to `/downloads`) and a plain "Blog" row last, per spec — the drawer no longer dumps the full `NAV_LINKS` list (Products/New Arrivals/Best Sellers/Videos/Downloads/Contact) the way it used to, since the bottom tab bar and this drawer's own promo row now cover most of that ground; the existing "Get a Sample" WhatsApp button stays at the bottom of the drawer since the tab bar's equivalent is hidden while this drawer is open.

**Filters drawer** (`src/components/products/mobile-filters-drawer.tsx`, mounted on `/products` only — "the main tiles listing," not category pages) — a two-pane master-detail drill-down, deliberately distinct from the category drawer's accordion: a `FILTERS` header, a ~35%-width left column of facet types (Color/Material/Size/Shape/Roof — same admin-editable `filter_types` data and `orderFilterTypes()`/`filterTypeLabel()` ordering the desktop `FilterBar` uses, extracted into `lib/product-filters.ts` so the two surfaces can't drift), and a ~65%-width scrollable right column of that facet's values with a badge count on the left row when any are active. Fully wired to the same `activeFilters`/`onToggle`/`onClearAll` as the desktop bar — same URL-reflected filter state, not a second filtering mechanism. The desktop chip-row `FilterBar` is hidden on mobile (`hidden lg:block`) so the two UIs don't stack.

The drawer's open/closed state is the `#mobile-filters` URL hash, not a query param — `parseFiltersFromSearchParams` (`lib/product-filters.ts`) treats every query key except `sort` as a real filter type, so a `?mfilters=1` param would have been misread as an attribute filter and silently broken the product query. **Found and fixed a real bug during QA**: `handleToggle`/`handleClearAll`/`handleSortChange` originally called `useSearchParams`'s setter, which drops the URL hash entirely — meaning every single tap on a filter value inside the drawer closed it immediately (`mobileFiltersOpen` is derived from `location.hash`). Fixed by replacing the setter with a custom `applySearchParams()` that calls `navigate()` directly, explicitly preserving `location.hash` on every update. Also found (via a live console-error check, not just visual QA) that 3 `SheetClose` usages had `nativeButton={false}` while wrapping an actual `<Button>` (a native `<button>`) instead of a `Link` — that flag is only correct for non-button render targets (per the `nativeButton` rule established back in batch 2); removed it from those 3 spots.

## AI chatbot + cached product summaries (2026-09-10)

Two features sharing one backend proxy (`khaprail-website/api/ai-chat.ts`, a Vercel serverless function — never called directly from the browser; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are server-only env vars). Full architecture/security detail is in `00-PROGRESS.md`'s AI chatbot batch entry — this section is the UI/visual summary.

**Cached PDP summary** (`src/components/pdp/ai-summary-card.tsx`) — a `bg-muted/50` bordered card with a small `SparklesIcon` + "AI-GENERATED SUMMARY" uppercase label above the text, so visitors never mistake it for official manufacturer copy. Reads `products.ai_summary` directly (no live call on page load); renders nothing at all when that column is null — no broken/empty-state card. Placed on the PDP right after the "About This Item" accordion. Generated once via a "Generate AI Summary" button on the admin product editor (never on a plain form save) — that button and a "Last generated" timestamp live in their own bordered section, separate from the regular product fields, so it's visually clear this is a distinct, deliberate action.

**Chat widget** (`src/components/shared/ai-chat-widget.tsx`, mounted globally in `SiteLayout`, every page) — **superseded 2026-09-10 (batch 29)**, see `00-PROGRESS.md`: rebuilt from the small popover described in the paragraph this replaces into a real shopping-assistant panel (near-full-screen mobile bottom sheet / `420px` desktop panel anchored bottom-left) with real `search_products` tool-use — the model returns tappable product cards built from actual Supabase rows, never invented text. Trigger button is a `bg-primary` circle + sparkle mark, bottom-**left** (avoids the WhatsApp bubble, bottom-right), with a gentle `chat-pulse-ring` CSS pulse (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`) and a one-time-per-session "Need help finding a tile?" greeting bubble. Panel header: brand-mark avatar + title, reset icon, close icon, "Today" divider. Quick-refine chips read the real (currently empty) `filter_types` table — honestly absent until Sylvester adds real values, not faked.

## Site-wide search (2026-09-10, batch 30)

Real search against the `products`/`categories` tables (name/category name, case-insensitive partial match) — never a fuzzy/fake "search" over hardcoded data. One shared query helper (`src/lib/product-search.ts`) backs three surfaces so they can't drift:

**Desktop navbar pill** (`src/components/nav/site-search.tsx`, in the navy sub-nav strip, pushed right via `ml-auto`) — a real, always-present `<input>` styled as a pill (`rounded-full border border-navy-foreground/25 bg-navy-foreground/10`, matching the tab-pill treatment used elsewhere), not a separate collapsed/expanded toggle — `focus-within:` styling alone gives it the "activates on interaction" look. Debounced 300ms (`src/hooks/use-product-search.ts`), results in a `role="listbox"`/`role="option"` popup (thumbnail, name, category, price — price omitted when null, never fabricated), capped at 6, with a "View all results" row always below. Full keyboard support: arrow keys move through results + the "View all" row, Enter activates, Escape closes.

**Mobile drawer search** (`src/components/nav/mobile-nav.tsx`) — the category drawer header's search icon swaps the category list for a full-width search sub-view (back arrow + input + same debounced result rows), not a separate modal.

**`/search?q=...`** (`src/pages/search-results.tsx`) — reuses the exact same grid/card/filter-bar/pagination stack as `/products` (`useProducts` gained an optional `searchQuery` param, intersected with any active filters via the same id-set approach the attribute-filter logic already used — not a second competing query path). Empty-query and no-results states both render real copy + a link back to `/products`, never a blank page.

## Spacing / layout

- Generous whitespace around product photography — don't crowd tile images, they need to read clearly at a glance
- 12-column grid, standard Tailwind spacing scale

## HCI & psychological principles to apply (not just decoration)

- **Hick's Law:** the real catalog has 25+ product types — never present them as one flat list. Group into visual collections (see 03-MEGA-MENU-SPEC.md).
- **Recognition over recall:** every filter, swatch, and menu item shows a photo, not just a name.
- **Fitts's Law:** primary CTAs ("Get a Sample," "Download Catalog," "WhatsApp Us") large and thumb-reachable — assume majority mobile traffic from Pakistan.
- **Von Restorff / isolation effect:** New Arrivals and Best Sellers get a visually distinct badge/card treatment, not just another grid row.
- **Progressive disclosure:** PDP shows essentials above the fold; specs/application info in an expandable accordion.
- **Provenance/trust signals:** "Since 1982" and craftsmanship story woven into the homepage hero and PDP, not buried only in About Us.
- **Honest data only:** no fabricated social proof. Real Supabase-backed counts, or nothing.

## Motion

- Framer Motion for micro-interactions (mega-menu card hover/lift, page transitions)
