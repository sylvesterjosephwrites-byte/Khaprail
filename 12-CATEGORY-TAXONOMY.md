# 12 — Category Taxonomy (Final)

Superseding all earlier drafts (2:37 AM / 3:22 AM voice notes) — this is the confirmed final list.

`[Bracket]` = main category. `(Parens)` = subcategory nested under the nearest main category.

## Main categories (15)

1. Wall Tiles — has subcategories, see below
2. Floor Tiles — has subcategories, see below
3. Roof Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
4. Khaprail Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
5. Outdoor Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
6. Kitchen Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
7. Bathroom Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
8. Terracotta Jali — flat, no subcategories yet
9. Pool Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
10. Industrial Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
11. Brick Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
12. Clay Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
13. Stone Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
14. Mosaic Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet
15. Terracotta Tiles — flat, no subcategories yet

## Subcategories

**Wall Tiles →** Kitchen Wall Tiles, Bathroom Wall Tiles, Outdoor Wall Tiles, Terracotta Wall Tiles, Concrete Wall Tiles, Mosaic Wall Tiles
  - **Kitchen Wall Tiles →** further split by material: Concrete, Terracotta, Ceramic

**Floor Tiles →** Kitchen Floor Tiles, Outdoor Floor Tiles, Bathroom Floor Tiles, Terracotta Floor Tiles, Concrete Floor Tiles

## Data model note

Modeled as a self-referencing `categories` table (id, name, slug, parent_id, cover_image_url, sort_order, created_at) so depth isn't hardcoded — this also lets flat categories above gain subcategories later without a schema change, just new rows.

```
categories (id, name, slug, parent_id NULL, cover_image_url, sort_order, created_at)
```

## Open item

The 11 flat categories above have no subcategories defined yet. Confirm with Sylvester whether they stay flat permanently, or whether subcategories are still to come for some of them (e.g. Roof Tiles, Khaprail Tiles) — don't assume either way when building out those category pages; build the flat version now, structure supports adding children later without rework.

## Implementation note (2026-08-25)

This taxonomy replaced the old flat `collections` table (Khaprail Roof Tiles, Multani Tiles, Terracotta Floor Tiles, Wall Tiles, Outdoor Tiles + 4 secondary lines — Grass Pavers/Fire Bricks/Blue Pottery/Wood-Fired Pizza Oven Bricks). Per Sylvester's decision: routes/nav/copy fully renamed from "Collections" to "Categories" everywhere, and the 4 secondary lines were dropped entirely (no products were assigned to them). The 17 real products were migrated onto the new `category_id`:

- Khaprail Roof Tiles (7 products: Barrel/Disco/Flat/French/Murlee/Spanish/Italian Taylor) → **Khaprail Tiles**
- Terracotta Floor Tiles (8 products) → **Floor Tiles → Terracotta Floor Tiles** (exact match)
- Multani Tiles (1×1, Penny Round — 2 products) → **Mosaic Tiles** — the one genuinely ambiguous mapping (no "Multani Tiles" analog exists in the new 15); flagging in case Sylvester wants these two reassigned elsewhere.

All 29 rows (15 main + 14 subcategory) are seeded with `cover_image_url` left `null` — no photography yet, same honest-empty pattern as every other table.
